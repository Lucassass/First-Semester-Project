/*
 This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 tries to interpret the line as a two word command. It returns the command
 as an object of class Command.
 The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
